Empowerd Grafana GUI

<!-- To help maximize the impact of your README and improve usability for users,
we propose the following loose structure:

## Overview / Introduction
Provide one or more paragraphs as an introduction to your plugin to help users
understand why they should use it.

Consider including screenshots:
- in [plugin.json](https://grafana.com/developers/plugin-tools/reference/plugin-json#info)
  include them as relative links.
- in the README ensure they are absolute URLs.

## Requirements
List any requirements or dependencies they may need to run the plugin.

## Getting Started
Provide a quick start on how to configure and use the plugin.

## Documentation
If your project has dedicated documentation available for users, provide links
here. For help in following Grafana's style recommendations for technical
documentation, refer to our [Writer's Toolkit](https://grafana.com/docs/writers-toolkit/).

## Contributing
Do you want folks to contribute to the plugin or provide feedback through
specific means? If so, tell them how!
